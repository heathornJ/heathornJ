## Who Am I?
Hi, I'm Jamie 👋 I'm a Junior Web Developer trying to break into a career in tech after taking the leap from warehouse work, travel, and online fitness coaching.

I'm a jack of all trades when it comes to life. I love fitness & travelling (especially snowboarding) as much as I love staying indoors and geeking out over D&D.

## What I Do
As I mentioned, I'm currently an online fitness coach, but I'm taking a leap into tech since that's always been my passion. In college I studied IT, and even during my warehouse work I was studying C# and game design. I took some time for what was essentially a career break before getting the practice wheels back on and taking a Front End Web Development course. Now, the rest is history.

Ideally, I seek to work within the health sector of Web Development since I have a lot of practical experience there, but I find myself easily fitting into most roles I take on.

## My Short Term Goal
My goal for the next few weeks/months is to get hired as a Junior Developer.

Additionally, I aim to build a web-app for a Card Game to further practice my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React skills.

I'll also be keeping track of these goals and expand upon them as I achieve them.
